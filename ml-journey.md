## My journey to become better at Machine Learning.

My experience with machine learning has been limited one. I took the course during my Master's degree at Clemson, however with my other subjects
and Systems research work, I could not dedicate enough time on the subject. Recently, All the news and awesome projects happening around, It has rekindled my interest
in the subject. We are witnessing something extraordinary right now in this field, and this could be turning point of human history. I really wish to be part of it. So I am starting my journey today from scratch.
I will chronicle my details here as much as possible. I will start with basic maths (Linear Algebra, Calculas, Discrete) and will go deep in the field. I will update the courses I am taking online, Projects I am doing,
Books I am reading, Research papers which fascinated me, APIs I have used etc etc. We will see how it goes. This is a side project from my work, and I am planning to dedicate 10-11 hours a week.

### Week 1 (April 11, 2016 - April 17, 2016)
### Tasks
- Finding the best resources for learning Machine Learning. I believe Quora has answer [wiki](https://www.quora.com/How-do-I-learn-machine-learning-1) for this question, and backed by many experts in the field.
- Refreshing Linear Algebra - [Khan Academy Course](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/linear-algebra) - 50 % this week
- Week 1 of Coursera course - [Machine Learning Foundations: A Case Study Approach](https://www.coursera.org/learn/ml-foundations) from University
  of Washington. I know I know.. Andrew Ng's Machine Learning [course](https://www.coursera.org/learn/machine-learning) is way better and highly recommended. However I have tried to do that course multiple times and was never able to finish it, for one reason or other.
  I will come back to it once, I have finished UofW course. Just for the fresh start.
- Refreshing Concepts of Probability/Statistics - [Khan Academy](https://www.khanacademy.org/math/probability) again, however this is a big course, and I plan to finish 30% this week.
